*(spanish: [\[ʈɒˈɾɛɾɔ\]](https://translate.google.com/#es/de/Torero%20torea%20el%20toro%20en%20el%20toreo.). Improved visualization with no Qt's Libraries dependecy*

**Torero** is a multi-platform graphical visualizer based in OpenGL, GLSL and GLFW. It was developed performance-wise and it should achieve maximum performance peak if multi-core processors and OpenCL/CUDA are available in your system. This current version only supports configuration through code.

There is a [wiki](https://github.com/DroidDrive/torero/wiki)!

You should read the [installation guide](https://github.com/DroidDrive/torero/wiki/1-Installation-guide) to setup all the necessary libraries and get your Visualizer ready to run.

Don't forget to observe which [coordinate systems](https://github.com/DroidDrive/torero/wiki/2-Coordinate-systems) the visualizer uses.

There are guides for each section of the API:

  * [Core](https://github.com/DroidDrive/torero/wiki/3-Core) – Main window.
  * Point cloud – Point cloud handler displays point clouds, it could accept different data structure inputs compatible with ROS, PCL and onwer defined data structure.
